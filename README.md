# Lasso Regression with PySpark MLlib

## Overview

This project implements **Lasso Regression** using PySpark's MLlib for hyperparameter tuning in a predictive modeling context. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization, which enhances the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the resulting model.

### Key Features
- **Lasso Regression**: A regularization method that applies L1 penalty to the regression, shrinking some coefficients to zero and selecting the most relevant features.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilizes cross-validation to optimize the regularization parameter (`lambda` or `alpha`), balancing model complexity and performance.
- **PySpark Integration**: Uses PySpark's distributed computing capabilities to efficiently handle large-scale data, making the model scalable for big datasets.

### Project Structure
- **Notebook (`Lasso_Regression_PySpark_MLlib.ipynb`)**: This Jupyter notebook contains:
  - Data preprocessing steps (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
  - Implementation of Lasso Regression
  - Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
  - Model evaluation and analysis of results (Mean Squared Error, R-squared, feature importance)

### Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

- **PySpark**: A fast and general-purpose distributed data processing engine with a machine learning library (MLlib).
- **MLlib**: Spark's scalable machine learning library.
  
You can install PySpark via pip:

```bash
pip install pyspark
```

### How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lasso-regression-pyspark.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd lasso-regression-pyspark
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Lasso_Regression_PySpark_MLlib.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, train the Lasso model, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance.

### Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your dataset is properly preprocessed:
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Encode categorical variables if necessary.
   - Split data into training and test sets.

2. **Train Lasso Regression Model**: 
   - Load your dataset and apply Lasso Regression using PySpark MLlib.
   - Tune the `alpha` parameter to achieve the best balance between underfitting and overfitting.

3. **Evaluate Model**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Analyze the feature importance determined by the Lasso regression.

### Results

The Lasso model performs feature selection while improving prediction accuracy by eliminating irrelevant or redundant variables. The final model will be evaluated on metrics such as:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **R-squared**: Indicates how well the model fits the data.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifies the most significant predictors in the model.
